# ⚙️ Django + Celery + Redis (Async Task Queue)

Welcome to my **Django Celery Redis** lab — a focused project where I implement asynchronous background task processing in Django using Celery with Redis as the message broker, all containerized using Docker.



## 🎯 Objective
To build a production-ready setup for running background tasks (such as image preprocessing, email sending, data processing, and long-running ML jobs) using:

- Django (backend)
- Celery (task queue)
- Redis (message broker)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for isolation & portability)

## 🚀 Features
- 🔄 Asynchronous task execution with Celery
- 🧠 Redis as a message broker
- 🐳 Dockerized architecture for easy dev & deploy
- 🖥️ Real-time task monitoring via Flower (optional)
- 📦 Scalable design to plug into larger ML or API projects

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django 4.x, Django REST Framework
- **Task Queue**: Celery 5.x
- **Broker**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Monitoring**: Flower (optional)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite (configurable)
